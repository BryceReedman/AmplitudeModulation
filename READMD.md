# Java implementation of Amplitude Modulation

## Why?
To demonstrate my understanding of on-off-keying A.K.A. Amplitude Shift Keying & to reinforce concepts

## Future Goals?
1. Create virtual NIC that uses the amplitude modulators & demodulators as a replacement for the physical layer
2. Play battlefield using the world's worst improvised network interface (speakers & microphones)

## How to play around with it?
Just open up the main class & run the main method to see a simple demonstration. Feel free to open the WAV file it produces in Audacity to see how the waveform appears
